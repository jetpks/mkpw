# mkpw - it makes passwords

Have you ever tried to type a password like this?
`"xa)=9qI%Tq3<0Ai2Drd!7JbT<-I^r6M`

It's difficult! Too easy to lose your place, impossible to catch mistypes,
and super hard to verbally relay to anyone.

Luckily there's a better way with passwords composed of random words. Like
this: `Bright5*foRthy`

* Easy to type and easy to say, because words.
* Easy to catch your mistypes, because you know `yield` is spelled with an `l`, not
  a `k`.
* More easily remembered, because it consists of only 4 elements.
* Just as secure as any other 16 character password.
* Still meets arcane complexity requirements by separating words with a
* random number and symbol.
* The tool can also make very long passwords: 
  `cLubland>5cryptaRch>5cirCumambages>5unOwed>5venoMsome>5Eland`
